## Project title
I chose as title of my project 'COVID 19 Statistics' which obviously reflects the major objective of the project.

## Motivation
<p>The coronavirus (COVID-19) has recently caused major global concern.
As the number of coronavirus cases increases, the spread of COVID-19 is a serious threat to global health.
However,the sources of information given are not reliable and consistent and they change as governments change policies.
Given the situation described above, in this project we offer a simple and intuitive web application 
for viewing data relating to COVID-19.
